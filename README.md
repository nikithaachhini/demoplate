# Demoplate

A small setup for simple demos for which you don't need to go to an online service. Also when you go for online service you'll have to depend on their browser compatibility. Any changes would directly refresh the browser and works similar across all browsers.

Currently it supports only HTML, CSS & JS.

## Installation
```
npm install
```

## Run
```
npm start
```

Make changes to any file and it'll reflect on every single browser you go to [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
